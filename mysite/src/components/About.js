                    <p>The twists and turns of life have taken me many places and given me a lifetime of experience. As a young man growing up in North Carolina, I found my first passion in life was music. I started studying guitar when I was quite young, and as a teenager decided I wanted to pursue it professionally. I was fortunate enough to study at some of the top music schools in the country, including the University of the North Carolina School of the Arts, Appalachian State University, and the University of Texas at Austin. My time spent as a music major profoundly influenced me, giving me a deep appreciation for art and beauty, as well as collaboration between other artists and individuals and deep respect for hard work, self-motivation, and personal achievement. 
                        <br/>Despite my endless love for music and art, I ultimately found that this path was not the one for me. I finished my degree in liberal arts, specifically literature and philosophy. Studying these other passions of mine gave me a well-rounded outlook on life, and a special appreciation for history, social issues, and the varieties of human thought and expression. My studies in the fine and liberal arts are core to my person, and are the biggest influences on my personality and vision for my life.
                        <br/>Though I was immensely satisfied with my studies, I found them to be difficult to translate into a career. After working many years in coffee as a roaster for a highly successful company in Boulder, CO, I found that I wanted more from my career. Through friends and family I discovered software engineering and decided that I wanted nothing more than to make coding a part of my future. In the fall of 2019 I applied for the Flatiron School in Denver to take their software engineering intensive. I found that coding unified many of my other passions: the creativity I express through art combined with the more rigorous disciplines of philosophy, especially logic. I am very excited to work down this new path in life, to become a professional software engineer and to see the fruition of many life goals through the limitless world of coding.
